# House Price Prediction Machine Learning Project

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area size, location, etc., which are used to predict the price of houses.


## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:

1. **Area:** The area size of the house in square feet.
2. **Bedrooms:** The number of bedrooms in the house.
3. **Bathrooms:** The number of bathrooms in the house.
4. **Location:** The location of the house.
5. **Year Built:** The year the house was built.
6. **Price:** The price of the house.
7.  And 16 more features
## Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**: This step involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and any other necessary preprocessing steps.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Selection**: Selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.
4. **Model Training**: Training the selected model on the preprocessed dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, etc.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the selected model to improve its performance.
7. **Prediction**: Using the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python:** Programming language used for coding.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation library used for data preprocessing.
- **NumPy:** Numerical computation library used for numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library used for model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Data visualization libraries used for visualizing data and model performance.
- **Keras:** Deep learning library used for creating and customizing ANN, CNN and RNN models.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to predict house prices based on various features. By building and fine-tuning machine learning models, we can accurately predict house prices, which can be valuable for real estate agents, homeowners, and buyers.
